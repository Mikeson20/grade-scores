Project Information:
A program that orders students grades.

Requirements:
1. Ordered by grade highest to lowest.
2. If grades are same, order by last name alphabetically.
3. If grades and lastname are same. Order by first name alphabetically.
4. Takes a file name as command line parameter.
5. Reads the file given above.
6. Each line of file data is formated like this: PEPPER, MARY, 86
7. From the file name given (R:4) amends "-graded.txt" to it.
8. Writes data to file created above (R:7) in the same format (R:6).

Brief:
Starts with a command line parameter, though does have a default file if one is not given.
Each charater is read and if a comma or new line is read it as added to its section (lastname, firstname, grade).
I decided to store data in a linked list, this may not be the best option as insert and search will have an 0(n) Time complexity.
A double linked list may be a better option, as a search/insert can start from both ends, maybe next version.
Backing up, when reading file at end of each new line the lines data is added to link list.
The data position is found before inserting it using myCompare function.
Once read and insert complete the given filename is amend by scrubing ".txt" and "-graded.txt" added to build new string(not elegantly).
Writes the linked list contents to the amned file name in the required format.

NOTES:
A makefile is included.
Does not have search function, as is not a requirement.
